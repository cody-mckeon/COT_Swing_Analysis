# COT_Swing_Analysis

## Hypothesis
If commercial hedgers (oil producers) or money managers (funds) are significantly long/short, there's a directional edge.

WE must verify that is the case via  backtest. Because COT is often a contrarian indicator. When money managers are extremely net long, a reversal often follows. When commercials are net long near extremes, they're absorbing selling - bullish for the price. 

COT data is published every Friday (based on Tuesday's positions)
